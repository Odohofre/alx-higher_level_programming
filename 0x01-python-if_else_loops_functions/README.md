## Mandatory

### [0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing](./0-positive_or_negative.py)

* This program will assign a random signed number to the variable **number** each time it is executed. Complete the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable **number** is positive or negative.

### [1. The last digit](./1-last_digit.py)

* This program will assign a random signed number to the variable **number** each time it is executed. Complete the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit.py) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable **number**.

### [2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](./2-print_alphabet.py)

* Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### [3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off](./3-print_alphabt.py)

* Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet without **q** and **e**, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### [4. Hexadecimal printing](./4-print_hexa.py)

* Write a program that prints all numbers from **0** to **98** in decimal and in hexadecimal

### [5. 00...99](./5-print_comb2.py)

* Write a program that prints numbers from **0** to **99**.

### [6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need](./6-print_comb3.py)

* Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

### [7. islower](./7-islower.py)

* Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

### [8. To uppercase](./8-uppercase.py)

* Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

### [9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important](./9-print_last_digit.py)

* Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

### [10. a + b](./10-add.py)

* Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### [11. a ^ b](./11-pow.py)

* Write a function that computes **a** to the power of **b** and return the value.

### [12. Fizz Buzz](./12-fizzbuzz.py)

* Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

### [13. Insert in sorted linked list](./13-insert_number.c)

* Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

## Advance

### [14. Smile in the mirror](./100-print_tebahpla.py)

* Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (**z** in lowercase and **Y** in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

### [15. Remove at position](./101-remove_char_at.py)

* Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position **n** (not the Python way, the “C array index”).

### [16. ByteCode -> Python #2](./102-magic_calculation.py)

* Write the Python function **def magic_calculation(a, b, c):** that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:

```bytecode
    3         0 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              3 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              6 COMPARE_OP               0 (<)
              9 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       16

    4        12 LOAD_FAST                2 (c)
             15 RETURN_VALUE

    5   >>   16 LOAD_FAST                2 (c)
             19 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
             22 COMPARE_OP               4 (>)
             25 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       36

    6        28 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
             31 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
             34 BINARY_ADD
             35 RETURN_VALUE

    7   >>   36 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
             39 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
             42 BINARY_MULTIPLY
             43 LOAD_FAST                2 (c)
             46 BINARY_SUBTRACT
             47 RETURN_VALUE
```
